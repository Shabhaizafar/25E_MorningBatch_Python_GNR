2. **Find the sum** of all elements in a list of numbers.
4. **Count** how many times the number `7` appears in a list.
7. **Print only even numbers** from a list of integers.

## ðŸŸ¡ **Intermediate Level (List Methods, Nested Lists, Logic)**

> Focus: List methods, slicing, comprehensions, multiple lists

1. **Remove all duplicates** from a list.
2. Write a program to **insert an element at a specific index** in a list.
4. Given a list of student marks, **find the average** and all marks **above average**.
9. Accept 5 names from user and **sort them alphabetically**.
10. Find the **second largest** number in a list.

## ðŸ”´ **Advanced Level (Real-world-like, List Comprehensions, Complex Logic)**

> Focus: Deep logic, nested structures, higher-order operations

1. **Group words by their length** from a given list.
   *(e.g., `["cat", "dog", "apple", "bat"]` â†’ `{3: ['cat', 'dog', 'bat'], 5: ['apple']}`)*
2. Given a list of strings, **filter all palindromes**.
3. **Implement a shopping cart** using a list where you can add, remove, view items.
4. Given a matrix (nested list), **transpose the matrix**.
5. Accept a sentence from user and **return list of unique words**.
6. **Split a list into chunks** of size `n`. (e.g., `[1,2,3,4,5,6], n=2` â†’ `[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]`)
7. **Create a frequency dictionary** from a list.
   *(e.g., `[â€˜aâ€™, â€˜bâ€™, â€˜aâ€™, â€˜câ€™, â€˜bâ€™]` â†’ `{'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}`)*
8. Create a list of student dictionaries and **sort them by marks**.
9. Given a list of transactions with positive and negative integers, **separate credits and debits**.
10. Create a program that accepts multiple sentences and **returns the top 5 most common words** using lists and logic.
