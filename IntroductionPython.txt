1. What is Python?
Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** that is easy to read and write. It's used to build all kinds of software — from websites and games to artificial intelligence and automation scripts.

- Created by **Guido van Rossum** in the early 1990s.
- Known for its **clean and readable syntax**.
- Works on almost every operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.).


/*
Level	        Description	                                                Examples
High-level	    Closer to human language, abstracted from hardware	        Python, Java, JavaScript
Mid-level	    Mix of high and low-level features	                        C, C++
Low-level	    Close to machine code, hardware-specific	                Assembly, Machine Code


High-level languages are easy to read and write.
Mid-level languages can interact with hardware (like pointers in C) but are still readable.
Low-level languages are hard to read but give full control over the hardware.
