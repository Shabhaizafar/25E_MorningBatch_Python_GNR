'''
A tuple is a built-in data type in Python used to store a collection of items. Tuples are similar to lists, 
but there are a few key differences:

Key Features of Tuples:
Ordered: Tuples maintain the order of the elements you insert.

Immutable: Once created, the elements of a tuple cannot be changed (unlike lists).

Allows duplicates: Tuples can have duplicate values.

Can contain different data types: Elements in a tuple can be of different types (e.g., integers, strings, lists, etc.).
